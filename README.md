# Smart-Medical-Alert

We want our solution to forecast possible emergency events, such as a heart attack, before they can happen to our user. We do this by training our neural network based machine learning model to predict whether or not the user may have a heart disease. With this model we have achieved 78% accuracy and we believe with more data points this can be improved
